WARNING!

Source parts are not stable yet. It's not uncommon that windows will stuck and completely freezes everything if VBS is executed as standalone!!!
On my computer it happened already :(
Additionally VBS cannot handle the GPU reload as long as wscript.exe isn't in the same directory as VBS-script.
Beside, your GPO has to allow VBS and wscript.exe, any other case might lead into fail.

Third-Party-Apps aren't included since I don't believe I've any rights to let it seem is I've written these fantastic tools.
